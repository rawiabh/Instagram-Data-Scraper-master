The depth control currently set for only keyword Search, Account Search is still open without any limit, but in future you may see Depth Controller for Account Search too.
- You may have Depth Search Controller in future release.
- Instagram Scraper doesn't follow any Standard API Rules (Because it's POC/Demo purpose only). If you thinking to make this as Commercial the Have OWN INSTAGRAM VALID API ACCESS, MODIFY THE REQUEST PART & ENJOY!

## Instagram-Super-Scraper V 2.1

Instagram Super Scraper is a PHP script which takes http://www.instagram/user-name/ as input and returns all information
related to user e.g. likes, comments, post count, images, likes on images etc... Currently only User Name, Biography, Followers,
Following, Posts, Likes, Comments & Views data in displaying. For other details you have to enable from php script code, Update
Controller/Instagram Class "public $result_type = 'JSON' or 'ARRAY';"

jQuery is using to build the Awesome View, to handle each and every request separately. I hope you like this small chunk of code
